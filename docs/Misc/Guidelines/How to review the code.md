# How to review the code

This document tells what to look for when reviewing a PR. It is everyone's responsibility to push quality code and reviewers are last step before it lands. Main guidelines for reviewer are as follows:

* When someone adds you as a reviewer make sure to review PR as fast as possible, as you are blocking author from further work.
* When reviewing a PR make sure to read through code carefully. If the PR contains a lot of changes - its okay to split who (one of reviewers) checks which file.
* Reviewer must ensure that [[Contribution]] guidelines are followed.
* It is recommended for a reviewer to pull changes and test them on their side, but its not mandatory. We should trust that PR author has tested their code before making a PR.

When reviewing a PR, make sure to use Githubs integrated tools. For example, you can comment specific lines - that way starting discussion. At the end, make sure you click on "Finish review" with appropriate resolution (approved, denied etc). Only approved PRs can be merged, so without this final step author would not be able to merge their changes into the codebase.
