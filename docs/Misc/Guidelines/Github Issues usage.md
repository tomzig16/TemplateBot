# Github Issues usage

Every feature, bug or any other task must be have issue created for it. Issues are used to track and discuss every task. Every issue is then moved to one of the [[Github Project usage|projects]] where further tracking of the task completion is done.

## Working with tickets

Issue cards (further tickets) can have asignees, so if you are working on a ticket - make sure to assign it to yourself so other people know that you are working on it and that way duplicate work can be avoided. If you have knowledge on a ticket that someone has already picked up - you can try and message them to group up. In the similar matter, if you have problems completing the task for any reason - ask people to join and help you.

Once you are done working on a ticket, make sure to move it in project to correct column.
