# Template Bot

This is still under construction, some of the things might and probably will change.

Hello, this is Template Bot - discord bot that lets server moderators enforce a template on certain channels. Once a template is enforced - all server members have to follow it for that specific channel. 

This is README file which is not official docs. We write and read Template Bot docs using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - an markdown editor. We are using it for the whole docs, so for the best experience we suggest opening "docs" folder inside it.

## Contribution

We accept any PRs and issues creation, but keep it clean and concise. 

### PR rules

+ PRs must be created from either a fork or a custom branch, which later on is merged into master branch (and deleted if its a branch on this repository).
+ PR must have title, description with details what PR does and why its needed. Empty PRs will be either dismissed or closed until issues are fixed.
+ PR must have details about the functionality, how it was tested.
+ It is strongly prefered that before creating a PR issue is created. If PR is created as a fix to an existing issue - make sure the issue is linked inside the PR.

### Issue rules

+ When creating an issue make sure that its possible to understand what's the aim of the issue from the title alone. Description is for further details.
