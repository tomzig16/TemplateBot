# Template Bot

This is still under construction, some of the things might and probably will change.

Hello, this is Template Bot - discord bot that lets server moderators enforce a template on certain channels. Once a template is enforced - all server members have to follow it for that specific channel. 

This is README file which is not official docs. We write and read Template Bot docs using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - an markdown editor. We are using it for the whole docs, so for the best experience we suggest opening "docs" folder inside it.
